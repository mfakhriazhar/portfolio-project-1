## Sales Force Training Optimization

Company X wants to increase sales after conducting training for sales workers. However, it needs to analyze whether the training is really effective in improving sales performance. Previously, the average sales per transaction was $100, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the training, the company collected recent data from 25 sales workers.

Goals:
-The main objective of this project was to measure the impact of training on sales performance and provide recommendations based on the analysis. 

This process included statistical analysis of recent sales data, evaluation of data variability, and hypothesis testing to determine if there was a significant change.

Insights:
-The analysis showed that the average sales increased to $102.6, but the t-test revealed that this change was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.686).
-This means that the training provided has not had a significant impact on increasing sales.
-If the company only relies on averages without statistical tests, the results can appear as if there is an increase. 
-However, with more in-depth analysis, it is found that this improvement is not significant, so the company needs to review the effectiveness of its training program.

Advice:
-Other solutions to increase sales, Company X can re-evaluate training materials, add other strategies such as incentives, additional training, or personalized approach in sales to increase its effectiveness.
